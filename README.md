# bno080

A rust embedded-hal driver for the Hillcrest Laboratories / Bosch Sensortec 
BNO080 9DOF AHRS

This sensor device combines a triple axis accelerometer, 
gyroscope, and magnetometer, and contains an ARM Cortex M0+ 
for fusing all the sensor data into a meaningful rotation vector. 

For reference, see the original 
[Hillcrest BNO080 driver](https://github.com/tstellanova/bno080-driver) implemented in C.
