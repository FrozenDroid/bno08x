# bno080

A rust embedded-hal driver for the Hillcrest Laboratories / Bosch Sensortec BNO080 9DOF IMU

This IMU combines a triple axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, and contains an ARM Cortex M0+ for fusing all the sensor data into meaningful rotation vector. 

For reference, see the original [Hillcrest BNO080 driver](https://github.com/tstellanova/bno080-driver) implemented in C.
